This small module helps content creators by overriding the 'save', 'add' and 'add existing' 
button labels on node forms and any inline entity forms.

This helps people by making it clear what kind of node they are saving, especially when 
inline entity forms are used with entity references are used, leading a form for one kind of 
node being open within a form for another.

It's a small issue, but it makes a difference to editors!


Installation
------------

Add to your modules directory and enable in the usual way.


TODO
----

Get working with when multiple node types are possible in an entity reference field.
